**Report: Social Network Analysis**

**Introduction**

A thorough analysis of social network data occurs through the combination of Python programming language and networkx library. The Facebook combined network serves as the data source with its 4,039 node elements and 88,234 edges. The study examines Facebook network structure by building the network followed by clustering coefficient analysis and density measurements and connected components study and centrality analysis and random graph model comparisons (Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz). The report ends by asking a research question about how to locate central nodes within the network system.
